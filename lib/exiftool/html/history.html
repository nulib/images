<li>ALL MAJOR PLANNED WRITING FEATURES NOW IMPLEMENTED!
<li>Finally solved problem of writing large preview images in JPEG files

    missing tags when the -f option is used
<li>Account for different encoding of Canon ExposureTime in 20D and 350D, and
    lower priority of Canon ExposureTime and FNumber so regular EXIF values take
    precedence because it appears these values may be model dependent (I hate it
    when that happens)

</ul>

<a name='v4.44'><b>Jan. 30, 2005 - Version 4.44</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Sort entries in synthesized Canon MakerNotes directory

<li>Added ability to write Canon RAW (CRW) files.  With this format you aren't
    allowed to add or delete any new tags (just as with the MakerNotes), except
    for JpgFromRaw, which I like to be able to delete to save disk space
<li>Added validation of JpgFromRaw images
<li>Relax filtering on non-ASCII characters by exiftool script to allow
    high-ASCII characters to be printed
<li>Changed the tense of Orientation values to try to make the meaning more
    clear.  This tag can be a bit confusing. It gives the rotation that must be
    applied to the image to view it properly (hence the rotation of the camera
    when the picture was taken).
<li>Patched problem which was causing failed tests on some platforms (floating
    point format has 3 digits in exponent on Perl 5.8.5 MSWin32-x86, grrrr...)
<li>API Changes:
    <ul>
    <li>Added 'Compact' option to not write blank padding as per XMP and IPTC

</ul>

<a name='v4.33'><b>Jan. 19, 2005 - Version 4.33</b></a>

<li>Added check at higher level and return warning if trying to delete
    information from maker notes

    accept when writing

</ul>

<a name='v4.32'><b>Jan. 19, 2005 - Version 4.32</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Now rewrites Casio EX-Z3 maker notes properly (well, not actually
    'properly', but the way they were written in the first place, which is
    wrong)
<li>Added warning when writing information if original IFD entries were not in
    the proper sequence, which is a violation of EXIF specs.  (And surprise,
    you'll never guess who does this too...  Yup, the EX-Z3.)
<li>Fixed parsing problem with GPSProcessingMethod and GPSAreaInformation
<li>No longer truncates 'undef' values at first null character
<li>Changed all DataDump tags to binary data types
<li>Changed some warning messages
<li>Documented the -m option (it's now official, even though it's been there
    since version 4.10)
<li>Added some more writer tests
</ul>

<a name='v4.31'><b>Jan. 18, 2005 - Version 4.31</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Now also copies over preview image in Nikon NEF files
</ul>

<a name='v4.30'><b>Jan. 18, 2005 - Version 4.30</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Now copies over preview images in EXIF data (large, external previews still
    not copied)
<li>Account for funny offsets in Casio EX-Z3 maker notes while extracting data
    (but haven't figured out how to handle them when writing)
<li>Fixed bug introduced in 4.20 that broke extraction of Canon PreviewImage
</ul>

<a name='v4.23'><b>Jan. 17, 2005 - Version 4.23</b></a>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Added check in -AllTagsFromFile to test for pointers in the maker notes
    directory running outside the maker notes data. If they do, a warning is
    issued and the maker notes are rebuilt properly before copying.

</ul>

<a name='v4.21'><b>Jan. 17, 2005 - Version 4.21</b></a>

<li>Added more validation when writing IPTC information
<li>Fixed display of Nikon FlashExposureComp for negative values
<li>Fixed problem where the large JPEG image in Nikon and Pentax raw files was
    misidentified as the ThumbnailImage.  It is now extracted as JpgFromRaw.
    This allows all 3 JPEG images contained in Pentax PEF files to be extracted:
    ThumbnailImage, PreviewImage and JpgFromRaw.
<li>Fixed problem on systems that use backslashes in directory names that
    prevented exiftool from finding its libraries if not installed
<li>Changed many Pentax tag names to remove "Pentax" prefix and conform more to
    the other tag names (moving information between files of different formats
    is much easier if tags have standardized names):
    <ul>
    <li>PentaxPictureMode =&gt; PictureMode
    <li>PentaxFocusMode =&gt; FocusMode
    <li>PentaxWhiteBalance =&gt; WhiteBalance
    <li>PentaxAEMetering =&gt; MeteringMode

</ul>

<a name='v4.14'><b>Jan. 10, 2005 - Version 4.14</b></a>

    (and added test to keep this from happening again!).

</ul>

<a name='v4.13'><b>Jan. 9, 2005 - Version 4.13</b></a>

<li>Added -E option to escape output values for HTML
<li>Fixed -w option to only replace extension after last '.' in filename if more
    than one '.'
<li>Unescape XMP character codes when extracting values (and escape again when
    writing)
<li>Now processes all IFD's of TIFF imags (not just IFD0)
<li>Added data length check in hex dump of verbose option
<li>Allow group name to be specified as prefix to tag name on command line
<li>Renamed a few Nikon tags: FlashExposureComp to FlashExposureBracketValue,
