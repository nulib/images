<h2 class='up'>ExifTool Object Data Members</h2>

<p>The following table lists the data members of the ExifTool object.  (If this
was C++, these would be documented next to the definitions in the header file,
but this is Perl, so I couldn't do that...)</p>

<p>Aside from the variables defined below, there may be other temporary
variables added by individual modules. Temporary variables are identified by at
least one lower case letter in their name, and are deleted before reading or
writing each new image. Make, Model and CameraType are temporary variables like
this, but these three are special because they are initialized to an empty
string instead of being deleted at the start of processing for each image, which
allows them to be tested without having to check for an undefined value.</p>

	writing (Note: entry may exist but be undefined for top-level

    <tr valign='top'><td>Data</td><td>-</td><td>data for PreviewImage to be written (may either be data
