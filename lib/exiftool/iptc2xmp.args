# Notes:        The following tags have the same names in both IPTC and XMP,
#               so they are covered by the first argument:  Category, City,
#               Credit, DateCreated, Headline, SupplementalCategories and
#               Urgency.
#
#               'Source' exists in both XMP-dc and XMP-photoshop but we want
#               to only write it to XMP-photoshop, and 'Keywords' exists in
#               XMP-pdf but we want to write it to XMP-dc:Subject, so we
#               exclude these tags from the mass copy and handle them
#               separately.
