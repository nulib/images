h2. Developer prereqs

Ruby 2.x
git
java jre (at least 1.6, but 1.8 will be more future proof when we start to use fedora 4)


h2. Installation and Configuration

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/nulib/images.git
bundle install
rake db:migrate
rake jetty:config
rake hydra:fixtures:refresh
rake db:test:prepare
</pre>

h3. Local development only

You'll need to install imagemagick to handle the tiff to jp2 conversion on your local machine.
<pre>
brew install imagemagick --with-libtiff --with-jp2
</pre>

h3. Install ClamAV

On OSX, the easiest way to get clamav is through homebrew
<pre>
brew install clamav
</pre>

h2. Running the application

<pre>
rake jetty:start
rails s
</pre>

h2. Testing the application

To test the multiresimage model, run: 
<pre>
rspec spec/models/multiresimage_spec.rb
</pre>

This section is a WIP:

To run selenium tests, first install firefox 24 ( https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/24.0/mac/en-US/Firefox%2024.0.dmg )

You'll need a .env file in the root of your applications directory that contains the user name and password of the user you'd like to use for testing.

Also make sure the rails server is running before running these selenium tests.

You'll need to be connected to the VPN.

<pre>
rspec spec/features/add_image_to_collection_spec.rb
</pre>
