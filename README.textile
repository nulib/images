h2. Developer prereqs

Ruby 2.x
git
java jre (at least 1.6, but 1.8 will be more future proof when we start to use fedora 4)

h2. Installation and Configuration

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/nulib/images.git
bundle install
rake db:migrate
rake jetty:config
rake hydra:fixtures:refresh
rake db:test:prepare
</pre>

h3. Local development only

You'll need to install imagemagick to handle the tiff to jp2 conversion on your local machine.
<pre>brew install imagemagick --with-libtiff --with-jp2</pre>

You'll also need redis running on port 6379
<pre>brew install redis</pre>
Then you can start sidekiq normally using <code>bundle exec sidekiq</code>

h2. Running the application

<pre>
rake jetty:start
rails s
</pre>

h2. Testing the application

To test the main image model, run:
<pre>
rspec spec/models/multiresimage_spec.rb
</pre>

The selenium tests require firefox 24 ( https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/24.0/mac/en-US/Firefox%2024.0.dmg )
Also make sure the rails server is running before running them. You'll need to be connected to the VPN.

To integration test the app, run:
<pre>
rspec spec/features
</pre>

You can run rspec spec to test the entire app.

h2. Deploying

We've got capistrano set up, so deploying *should* be as easy as 'cap environment deploy'.
Keep in mind that a deploy only copies over whatever files are in the public github repo, so many config files don't get copied during a deploy. You'll need to copy them over manually or run cap deploy setup.

h2. stuff to remember
the dropbox mount isn't managed by puppet
