Please note that you may have to wait a few minutes for all your images to appear in your group.</p>

<p>Your personal groups will appear on the left side of the page. Click on the title of a group to open it. Reorder images in a group by clicking and holding on the title of the image (below the thumbnail) and drag the image either to the right or left of another image.
